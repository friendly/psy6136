# Quiz 2: Two-way Tables


Test your knowledge of the material on [two-way tables](../lectures/03-Twoway1.pdf) in the following quiz.

1. **What is the _best_ way to test the significance of the association between two categorical variables in a two-way frequency table?**
  a) Using a chi-square test
  b) Using a t-test
  c) Using a one-way ANOVA
  d) Using a linear regression

2. **What is the best measure used to quantify the _strength_ of association between two categorical variables in a two-way frequency table?**
  a) Chi-square test
  b) Cramer's _V_
  c) Pearson's correlation coefficient
  d) Odds ratio
  e) None of the above

3. **What is the _null hypothesis_ for a chi-square test of independence in a two-way frequency table?**
  a) The two variables are independent
  b) The two variables are dependent
  c) The two variables are correlated
  d) The two variables are not correlated

4. **What is the _alternative hypothesis_ for a chi-square test for independence in a two-way frequency table?**
  a) The two variables are independent
  b) The two variables are dependent
  c) The two variables are uncorrelated
  d) None of the above

5. **What are the assumptions for the validity of a chi-square test for independence in a two-way frequency table?**
a) The observations are independent and randomly sampled
b) The expected frequencies for each cell in the table are greater than 5
c) The variable are categorical
d) All of the above

6. **When interpreting the results of a chi-square test for independence in a two-way frequency table, what does a _p_-value of less than 0.05 indicate?**
  a) There is evidence of association between the two variables
  b) There is no evidence of association between the two variables
  c) The variables are correlated
  d) The variables are uncorrelated

8. **What is the null hypothesis for a chi-squared test for independence in a two-way frequency table?**
  a) The variables are independent
  b) The variables are dependent
  c) The variables are not normally distributed
  d) The variables have equal variances

9. **How do you interpret the _p_-value in a chi-squared test for independence in a two-way frequency table?**
  a) A small _p_-value indicates evidence against the null hypothesis
  b) A large _p_-value indicates evidence against the null hypothesis
  c) A small _p_-value indicates evidence in favor of the null hypothesis
  d) A large _p_-value indicates evidence in favor of the null hypothesis.

10. **When both variables are _ordered_ in a two-way frequency table, the most focused test for association is:**
  a) The Pearson chi-squared test
  b) The Likelihood ratio chi-squared test
  c) The CMH test for general association
  d) The CMH test for non-zero correlation
