## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML,
 PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
You should get the [R Markdown cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets).

You can get something like this from RStudio, via the menu options **File -> New File -> R Markdown ...**,
then choose **Document**.  This template adds some additional stuff in the default header,
and sets some knitr options that I find useful.  If you use this, simply delete everything
from this section title to the end!

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Text

Text can be decorated with **bold** or *italics*, or even ~~crossed-out~~.  It is also possible to 

* create [links](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) 
* include mathematics like $e=mc^2$ or a display equation,
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$

Be sure to put a space after the * when you are creating bullets and a space after # when 
creating section headers, but **not** between $ and the mathematical formulas.

Numbered lists:

1. First item
2. second item

Definition lists, sometime useful:

foo
: Something arbitrary I want to to talk about

bar
: foo's partner, another highlighted topic


## Inline R code

Did you know that the `mtcars` data set has
`r nrow(mtcars)` observations and `r ncol(mtcars)` variables?
Here, I used backticks (\` \`) around "mtcars" to have it appear as verbatim code, `mtcars`.

## Graphics

If the code of an R chunk produces a plot, this plot will be displayed in the resulting file.
```{r plot-mpg, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(mpg ~ disp, data=mtcars, 
     pch=16, 
     xlab="Engine displacement",
     ylab="Gas mileage (mpg)")
```


You can control the size of figures using chunk options, `fig.width`, `fig.height`.
There are different ways to show several figures side-by-side. Here, I
used `fig.show="hold"` and `out.width="49%"` to size them to fit side-by-side.

```{r two-plots, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, out.width="49%", fig.show="hold"}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```


### Subsection title

* Intersperse R code chunks with explanatory text as needed.

* Press the `Knit` button in the toolbar to process the `.Rmd` file into an `.html` (or `.pdf` or `.docx`) file.

* For more information on using R Markdown in RStudio press the ? button in the toolbar or visit <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>.

### Documenting file creation 

It's sometimes useful to record some information about how your file was created.  You don't need to use
this unless it is important.

  * File creation date: `r Sys.Date()`
  * Using `r R.version.string`
  * R version (short form): `r getRversion()`
  * `vcdExtra` package version: `r packageVersion("vcdExtra")`
  * Additional session information
  
```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()  # could use devtools::session_info() if you prefer that
```
