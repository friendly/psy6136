This is the github repo for the web pages of my course, [*Psychology 6136: Categorical Data Analysis*](https://friendly.github.io/psy6136), a graduate-level course taught at York University.

It uses my book, [*Discrete Data Analysis with R: Visualization and Modeling Techniques for Categorical and Count Data*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b19022/discrete-data-analysis-michael-friendly-david-meyer),
and accompanying web site http://ddar.datavis.ca.

The web materials for this course are hosted on https://friendly.github.io/psy6136.
A previous version of this course was at
https://www.yorku.ca/friendly/psy6136/, now obsolete. 


### Course description

This course is designed as a broad, applied introduction to the statistical analysis of categorical (or discrete) data, such as counts, proportions, nominal variables, ordinal variables, discrete variables with few values, continuous variables grouped into a small number of categories, etc. 

* The course begins with methods designed for cross-classified table of counts, (i.e., contingency tables), using simple chi square-based methods. 

* It progresses to generalized linear models, for which log-linear models provide a natural extension of simple chi square-based methods. 

* This framework is then extended to comprise logit and logistic regression models for binary responses and generalizations of these models for polytomous (multicategory) outcomes.

Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on associated graphical methods for visualizing categorical data, checking model assumptions, etc. Lab sessions will familiarize the student with software using R for carrying out these analyses.
