# Quiz 1: Discrete Distributions


Test your knowledge of the material on [discrete distributions](../lectures/02-Discrete.pdf) in the following quiz.

1. **What are the assumptions necessary for a variable to be distributed as a binomial distribution?**
  a) The variable must be binary
  b) The variable must be discrete
  c) The variable must have a fixed number of trials
  d) All of the above

2. **How does the skewness of a binomial variable relate to its parameters _n_ and _p_?**
  a) Skewness = n p
  b) Skewness = n/p
  c) Skewness = p (1-p) / n
  d) Skewness = p^2 / n

3. **When would you use a negative binomial distribution over a Poisson distribution?**
  a) When the number of trials is fixed
  b) When the variance exceeds the mean
  c) When there are negative counts in the data
  d) When the parameter p differs substantially from 0.5

4. **How does the mean and variance of a Poisson distribution relate to its parameter λ?**
  a) Mean = λ, Variance = λ
  b) Mean = 1/λ, Variance = 1/λ^2
  c) Mean = 1/λ, Variance = λ
  d) Mean = λ, Variance = λ^2

5. **Which example is most likely to follow a log-series distribution?**
  a) Number of accidents at a busy intersection
  b) Counts of occurrences of distinct words in the books written by Jane Austin
  c) Number of births of males in Canadian families composed of 6 children
  d) Number of tosses of a coin required to get the first head.
 

6. **Which of the following characterize the negative binomial distribution and the geometric distribution?
  a) The negative binomial distribution models the number of failures before a specified number of successes
  b) The geometric distribution models the number of failures before the first success
  c) Both A and B
  d) Neither A nor B

7. **In what type of data might you use a negative binomial distribution?**
  a) Count data
  b) Binary data
  c) Continuous data
  d) Both A and B

8. **What is the mean and variance of a variable distributed as a geometric distribution?**
  a) Mean = λ, Variance = λ
  b) Mean = 1/λ, Variance = 1/λ^2
  c) Mean = 1/λ, Variance = λ
  d) Mean = λ, Variance = 1/λ^2


## Answers

1: d;
2: c;
3: b;
4: a;
5: b;
6: c;
7: b (bad question-- DDAR defines the geometric distribution in terms of the parameter _p_);
8: d
