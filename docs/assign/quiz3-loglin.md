# Quiz 3: Loglinear models


Test your knowledge of the material on [loglinear models](../lectures/04-Loglin.pdf) in the following quiz.

* **What is the main difference between loglinear models and chi-squared test for independence in two-way frequency tables?**
  a) Loglinear models allow for estimation of parameters for interactions among variables while chi-squared test only tests for independence
  b) Loglinear models allow for non-normal data while chi-squared test do not
  c) Loglinear models apply in small sample size while chi-squared test require large sample size
  d) Loglinear models allow for estimation of parameters for interactions among variables and also for non-normal data and for large sample size and for easy interpretation of results while chi-squared test only tests for independence
