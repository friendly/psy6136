## Class meetings {#meetings}

* Tuesday 2:30 pm - 5:30 pm, 
in 014A BSB. Lab sessions will be held in the Hebb Computer lab, 159 BSB.

## Class discussion forum

This term we will be using eClass for class discussion. The system is designed to make it
easier to communicate with your classmates, the TA, and myself.
Rather than emailing questions to a listserv or to us individually, 
I encourage you to post your questions on eClass. 

Students in the course are automatically subscribed.

## Course Description {#description}

This course is designed as a broad, applied introduction to the statistical analysis of categorical (or discrete) data, such as counts, proportions, nominal variables, ordinal variables, discrete variables with few values, continuous variables grouped into a small number of categories, etc. 

* The course begins with methods designed for cross-classified table of counts, (i.e., contingency tables), using simple chi square-based methods. 

* It progresses to generalized linear models, for which log-linear models provide a natural extension of simple chi square-based methods. 

* This framework is then extended to comprise logit and logistic regression models for binary responses and generalizations of these models for polytomous (multicategory) outcomes.

Throughout, there is a strong emphasis on associated graphical methods for visualizing categorical data, checking model assumptions, etc. Lab sessions will familiarize the student with software using R for carrying out these analyses.

## Assignments {#assign}

There will be occasional short assignments posted here and announced in class. These assignments are
ungraded, unless a graded assignment is announced in advance.  Details regarding a useful way of
formatting R exercises are described in [Assignment 1](assign/assign1.pdf).
See [Render an R script to a report](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/spin.html),
which describes how to compile HTML, PDF, or MS Word notebooks from R scripts for further details.

Please submit your assignments to me by email, as a PDF, Word, or HTML attachment
(together with the associated R file),
with
a Subject: line "**PSYC 6136: Assignment XX**".
To help me keep them straight, it would be most convenient to name them in a consistent style, something like
"YourName-AssignXX.{pdf,docx,html}".

## Evaluation {#evaluation}

**NB**: This description and weighting of components is under review, particularly the weighting for components and
a final project. See [6136 Individual or Team Projects](assign/projects6136.html) for my current ideas.

There are three  components to your evaluation in the course: two take-home projects (each worth 40%) that will involve analysis of one or more data sets together with a research report describing the background, your analyses, results and conclusions. For these, you can use any software you like, although R is strongly encouraged.

Here is a [template for a markdown .Rmd file](assign/RMarkdown-template.Rmd)
you can use if you are working in RStudio and want to
write in R markdown.

1. [Project 1](assign/project1.pdf):
a selection of data sets for the material up to and including logistic regression. Due date: Feb. 13???

2. [Project 2](assign/project2.pdf):
a selection of data sets for the material from logistic regression to the end of the course. Due date: Mar. 15???

3. The remaining 20% can be earned either as

  * an assignment portfolio, containing a selection of your best work (possibly edited/enhanced) on a selection of assignment questions, or by
  * reading and discussing a journal article related to theory or application of categorical data analysis. For the latter, you can volunteer to give a brief (~15 min) presentation to the class (sometime in March) to earn bonus marks. Due date: Apr 5???
